The tables in this program must be declared to contain 10 elements, because we will have a maximum of 10 integers.
We have 1 integer for each day for up to 10 days.

The advantage of arrays is that we can keep multiple values ??under a single variable, but the disadvantage is that 
we need to know the size of the arrays in advance. The tables also have a fixed size, which means that we can not 
increase or decrease the allocated memory.

It is preferable to initialize the iterations to zero because the values ??stored in an array start from zero, so if 
we want to printf the first stored value in the array we must start with zero, that is to say:
for (i = 0; i <4; i ++)
printf ("grade1", grade [i]);
in this case the machine will go into the array take the first value instead 0 number and display.
so that's why it's best to start at zero.
