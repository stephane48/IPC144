Using pseudo-coding let me see my overall code so I could form logic easier and quicker.
In later stage, it helped me focus only on algorithm/syntax part while writing code. 
Another side benefit of pseudo was that my friends and I could discuss our ideas easily,
 without the need to look through all the variables and code line. 

In my code, I used "for" and "while" loop. I didn't use do...while because I need to check 
 the condition first be verified before executing next lines. I used "for" loop for inputing 
days because I knew there were only 3/4 ldays. I used "while" loop for input condition because
I did not know how much loops (or error) until user filled in right.

The most difficult part was the part that we had to determine the highest and lowest temperature 
among thoses days and also Debugging was the one that helped me to complete the code. This was a 
rather complex problem, and there were lots of variables so I sometimes got lost and did not know where I was. 
I remembered running debug at least 9-12 times, it was so helpful.
