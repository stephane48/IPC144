The at home part of workshop turned out to be really challenging. This part adds two more switch statements along with
the previous part of the workshop. The additional two switch statements engage in update employee data and remove 
employee data respectively. Moreover, upon inserting wrong ID, those would return error statement and prompt the
user to enter the correct ID. Upon entering the correct ID, the program would update or remove employee data in accordance
with the switch statements.With a view to acheiving this, the code accommodates complex nested structure of iteration construct,
if statements, flags etc.

The struct construct gives the liberty to use multipme data type contained in one single container and when the necessity
to use those data type arises, only by calling the struct name would suffice. On the other hand, to use parallel arrays
arrays each containg homogenous data type need to be called separately for the prgram to work. Therefore, using struct construct 
over parallel arrays is efficient.

In this workshop the Employee struct is declared in the file named emp_athome.c. However, this struct could also be declared
globally in a header file named Employee.h. The advantage of using a header file is each instance the employee construct is 
needed only mentioning the header file containing the employee struct would suffice as opposed to creating the construct repeatedly.
