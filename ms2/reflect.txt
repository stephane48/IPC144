1. No, I believe I’ve used the most useful way to get the users' data,
using the techniques we learned so far. Through having structs to keep
multiple arrays and asking the user by prompt makes the most sense to me,
it also seems like the simplest way. 

2. For example, I simply prompted the user for values and placed them in
an array, this is very simple,and I believe efficient as if any problem 
arises, I have separated everything into small sections, I could’ve made 
more functions, but I didn’t want a new function for every small task.

3. In a c string, everything in the quotation marks is one big string and 
must have a null byte at the end to signify the end of the string. A character 
array stores character values in an array, for example, char array [ ] = {H’,’i’,’\0’};. 
If the %s is used in the mistake of the %c the program will cut when a blank 
space is seen, acting as a null and terminating the spring.
