Throughout this workshop 2, I encountered a lot of difficulties because of 
these I also learned a lot, and all this allowed me to deepen my knowledge.

At first, what was interesting for me was the different mathematical operations 
that had to be performed at each time to determine the different values 
(quarters, dimes, GST, and so on), and in the end it was the most difficult for me because 
I did not know about quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies because I had never heard that in the past.
Secondly, the conversion of floating-point values into integers still called casting is often recommended 
because it allows us to have the exact values or the entire part without any arithmetic operation; in other words, it makes things easier.
Subsequently, when using the operation division, it evaluates only the truncated integer result; 
that is, the whole number without remainder, while the module operator evaluates only the rest.

Finally, the workshops for me is a way for me to practice what we do in class and it allows me to practice better.
